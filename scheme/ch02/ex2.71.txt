When the weights are 1, 2, 4, ..., 2**(n-1) then for n=5, we have these ordered pairs:

((a 1) (b 2) (c 4) (d 8) (e 16))

which yields this tree:
        +
       / \
      +   e
     / \
    +   d
   / \
  +   c
 / \
a   b


So, 1 bit is required to encode the most frequent symbol and (n-1) bits are required for the least frequent.
